          Hi, I’m Gina! I’ve been quilting for many years, starting with small
          projects and gradually moving on to larger, more detailed quilts. What
          started as a hobby quickly grew into a passion, and now I create
          custom quilts for families, friends, and clients who want something
          truly meaningful and unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in T-shirt quilts, baby quilts, wall hangings, and more.
          Each quilt is made with love and attention to detail, using
          high-quality fabrics and professional quilting techniques. My goal is
          to create something that tells your story and lasts for generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not quilting, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring
          new patterns, and teaching others about the joy of quilting. Whether
          you’re looking for a memory quilt to preserve cherished shirts or a
          special handmade gift, I’d love to help bring your vision to life.
