					<p>
						I made this t-shirt quilt for my oldest son. It includes shirts all
						the way from when he played T-ball to when we graduated college. The
						border and backing fabric is Linen Texture in Grey and Navy by
						Kimberbell. The edge to edge quilting design is called Diagonal
						Plaid.

						This was the first t-shirt quilt I made just to try it out and see
						how it would work. This was for my 2nd oldest son.

					<p>
						This was a fun Christmas project! This picture was taken before I
						finished the quilt, but 84 blocks of sewing later and it was done!

					<p>
						I made this as a wedding gift for my oldest and his wife. I made it
						to be a picnic quilt and it was the first quilt I ever quilted on a
						long arm!
